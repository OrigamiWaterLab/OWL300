# Ribs

## Introduction

The OWL300 uses horizontal ribs to withstand the outward hydrostatic forces. The rib is a board of plastic sheet that runs perpendicularly on the outside of the plant. It is held in place on either end with a pipe at right angle that acts as a pin. Here's one rib:

And here's the outer structure assembly:

The goal of this document is to determine optimal rib spacing and size.

## Rib Spacing

The first failure mode to consider is when the side walls are not supported often enough, and they rupture in between ribs. For this scenario, we consider the ribs to be infinitely strong, and we place them further and further apart to determine at what point will the wall fail.

To determine the total force acting on the wall generated by hydrostatic pressure, we can use the following equation:

```python
from aide_design.play import *

def vertical_wall_hydrostatic_force(h, w, water_height_above_wall=0*u.m, rho=exp.DENSITY_WATER, g=u.gravity):
  """Calculate the total hydrostatic force acting on a vertical wall.

  Parameters
  ----------
  h : L
      height of the wall resisting the force
  w : L
      width of the wall resisting the force
  water_height_above_wall : L
      height of the water above where the wall starts. This is used to
      calculate the static pressure difference between the two sides of the wall
  rho : kg/m^3
      The density of the fluid causing the hydrostatic forces
  g : m/s^2
      Gravity... I imagine this won't be changing!

  Returns
  -------
  Force
      The total force generated across the wall
  """
  return (rho*g*h**2/2*w + rho*g*water_height_above_wall*h*w).to(u.newton)

# Test for 10 cm
vertical_wall_hydrostatic_force(10*u.cm, 1.22*u.m, water_height_above_wall=1.22*u.m)


```

Now, we model the wall as a simply supported beam, with the ribs being the support at either end. According to wikipedia, the governing equation is:

>the elastic deflection (at the midpoint C) of a beam, loaded at its center, supported by two simple supports is given by:
>\[
>\delta_{C}={\frac  {FL^{3}}{48EI}}
>\]
>where:
>* F  = Force acting on the center of the beam
>* L = Length of the beam between the supports
>* E = Modulus of Elasticity
>* I = Area moment of inertia of cross section

Showing that the deflection increases with the distance between the ribs cubed, which suggests that the point of worse deflection will be at the top of the tank, where the ribs are the furthest apart (even though the wall is withstanding the least hydrostatic forces.)

So to determine the max distance between ribs, given the max allowable deformation, we can solve for L:

```python

def simply_supported_beam_length_central_deflection(max_deflection, F, E, I):
  """
  the elastic deflection (at the midpoint C) of a beam, loaded at its center, supported by two simple supports is given by:
  \[
  \delta_{C}={\frac  {FL^{3}}{48EI}}
  \]
  where:
  * F  = Force acting on the center of the beam
  * L = Length of the beam between the supports
  * E = Modulus of Elasticity
  * I = Area moment of inertia of cross section  
  """
  return (max_deflection*48*E*I/F)**(1/3)


```

The following are the properties for acrylic, PVC and ABS:
Materials  | Modulus of Elasticity  |   |  
--|---|---|--
ABS  |   |   |  
Acrylic  |   |   |  
PVC  |   |   |  


Therefore, to optimize materials by equalizing rib loading, fewer ribs are needed in the higher portion of the plant.

The goal of the ribs is to reduce deformation at the center of each wall span.

The hydrostatic pressure increases linearly with depth, according to:
